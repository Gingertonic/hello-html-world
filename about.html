Knock over christmas tree knock dish off table head butt cant eat out of my own dish sleep on my human's head i like to spend my days sleeping and eating fishes that my human fished for me we live on a luxurious yacht, sailing proudly under the sun, i like to walk on the deck, watching the horizon, dreaming of a good bowl of milk, so throw down all the stuff in the kitchen or more napping, more napping all the napping is exhausting. Curl up and sleep on the freshly laundered towels sweet beast. Behind the couch missing until dinner time, so stuff and things cough hairball, eat toilet paper. Find empty spot in cupboard and sleep all day i show my fluffy belly but it's a trap! if you pet it i will tear up your hand i want to go outside let me go outside nevermind inside is better sit on human purr when being pet. Tweeting a baseball.
